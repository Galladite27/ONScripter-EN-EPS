# ONScripter-EN-EPS
*Extended Platform Support for modern ONScripter-EN*

## Last updated
7 October 2024

## Introduction
This is the ONScripter-EN-ESR repository, containing CMake files and any other fixes and information required to get [modern ONScripter-EN](https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-EN) working on a wide variety of different platforms, from alternative desktop operating systems to even games consoles! This repository isn't intended to be cloned directly except if you intend to contribute to it; rather, it is downloaded from the main ONScripter-EN repository as needed. Please see the [Usage](#Usage) section for more information.

## Progress
(Playmer, please put your chart here)

## Usage
**Note:** EPS versions of onsen are *not* intended for use preferably to the main releases. Support for EPS versions is not a guarantee - there are simply too many platforms for us to manage every single one. If you find a bug, why don't you help us fix it? :)

Please see the file [BuildInstructions.md](https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-EN-EPS/blob/master/BuildInstructions.md) for usage information.

*"Correspondence in English, or regarding issues related to this branch in particular, should be directed to [@Galladite27](https://github.com/Galladite27) or to [@lightbinder](https://github.com/lightbinder), as it contains a large number of customisations that have nothing to do with Ogapee, and neither Haeleth nor Uncle Mion are actively maintaining ONScripter-EN."*
