Notes to Playmer:

I'm happy to help with this, but you're free to do it yourself if you'd rather: the build instructions need updating regarding the new system. At some point, I'll tweak the build instructions file in the main repo to cover just the main methods of compilation, or otherwise explain how to use this repo.
